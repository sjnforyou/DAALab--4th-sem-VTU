List of Experiments
1. A. Create a Java class called Studentwith the following details as variables within it.
    (i) USN
    (ii) Name
    (iii) Branch
    (iv) Phone
    Write a Java program to create nStudent objects and print the USN, Name,
    Branch, and Phoneof these objects with suitable headings. 
    
  B.Write a Java program to implement the Stack using arrays. Write Push(), Pop(),
    and Display() methods to demonstrate its working. 
    
2.A. Design a superclass called Staff with details as StaffId, Name, Phone, Salary.
    Extend this class by writing three subclasses namely Teaching (domain,
    publications), Technical (skills), and Contract (period). Write a Java program to
    read and display at least 3 staff objects of all three categories.
    
B.Write a Java class called Customer to store their name and date_of_birth. The
	date_of_birth format should be dd/mm/yyyy. Write methods to read customer
	data as <name, dd/mm/yyyy> and display as <name, dd, mm, yyyy> using
	StringTokenizer class considering the delimiter character as “/”. 
		
3.A.Write a Java program to read two integers a andb. Compute a/b and print, when
	 	b is not zero. Raise an exception when b is equal to zero. 		
B.Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three
		threads. First thread generates a random integer for every 1 second; second
		thread computes the square of the number andprints; third thread will print the
		value of cube of the number.
