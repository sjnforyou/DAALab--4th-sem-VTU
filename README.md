Just hve to write something and go with it and make it happen


List of Experiments
1. A. Create a Java class called Studentwith the following details as variables within it.
    (i) USN
    (ii) Name
    (iii) Branch
    (iv) Phone
    Write a Java program to create nStudent objects and print the USN, Name,
    Branch, and Phoneof these objects with suitable headings. 
    
  B.Write a Java program to implement the Stack using arrays. Write Push(), Pop(),
    and Display() methods to demonstrate its working. 
    
2.A. Design a superclass called Staff with details as StaffId, Name, Phone, Salary.
    Extend this class by writing three subclasses namely Teaching (domain,
    publications), Technical (skills), and Contract (period). Write a Java program to
    read and display at least 3 staff objects of all three categories.
    
B.Write a Java class called Customer to store their name and date_of_birth. The
	date_of_birth format should be dd/mm/yyyy. Write methods to read customer
	data as <name, dd/mm/yyyy> and display as <name, dd, mm, yyyy> using
	StringTokenizer class considering the delimiter character as “/”. 
		
3.A.Write a Java program to read two integers a andb. Compute a/b and print, when
	 	b is not zero. Raise an exception when b is equal to zero. 	
		
B.Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three
		threads. First thread generates a random integer for every 1 second; second
		thread computes the square of the number andprints; third thread will print the
		value of cube of the number. 
4.Sort a given set of n integer elements using Quick Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000 and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using Java how the divide-and-conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case. 
5.Sort a given set of n integer elements using Merge Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000, and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using Java how the divide-and-conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case. 
6.Implement in Java, the 0/1 Knapsack problem using (a) Dynamic Programming method (b) Greedy method. 
7.From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm. Write the program in Java.
8.Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected undirected graph using  Kruskal'salgorithm. Use Union-Find algorithms in your program.
